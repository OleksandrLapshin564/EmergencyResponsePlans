        " - separate operational parts for levels 'A', 'B', 'C', developed as separate books for each hazardous facility.",
        "3. The development of the PLAS in this form allows:",
        " - to ensure a quick search for information regarding the hazard of a specific facility;",
        " - in the event of an accident, use exactly the book that is intended for the corresponding level of accident at a specific facility;",
