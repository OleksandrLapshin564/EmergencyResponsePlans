<h2>First Aid Procedures</h2>
<p>First aid is the immediate care given to an injured or suddenly ill person before professional medical help arrives. Quick and correct action can save lives and reduce the severity of injuries.</p>

<h3>Basic First Aid Steps:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Check Safety:</strong> Ensure the scene is safe before approaching the injured person.</li>
    <li><strong>Assess the Victim:</strong> Check for responsiveness, breathing, and pulse.</li>
    <li><strong>Call Emergency Services:</strong> Contact local medical help immediately.</li>
    <li><strong>CPR:</strong> If the person is not breathing, begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</li>
    <li><strong>Stop Bleeding:</strong> Apply pressure with a clean cloth or bandage.</li>
    <li><strong>Burns:</strong> Cool the burn with running water, avoid applying oils or creams.</li>
    <li><strong>Fractures:</strong> Immobilize the injured limb and avoid unnecessary movement.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember the three C’s of First Aid: <strong>Check — Call — Care.</strong></p>
