    <p>
        An evacuation plan is a structured strategy that ensures the safe and orderly movement of people
        away from dangerous or potentially dangerous areas. Having a clear evacuation plan saves lives
        during emergencies such as fires, earthquakes, floods, or industrial accidents.
